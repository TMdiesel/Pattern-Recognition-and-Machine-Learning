# Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning
This code implements bayesian machine learning algorithms described in "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop, which is available from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1263391804&sr=8-2#reader_0387310738). It is written purely in Python.
